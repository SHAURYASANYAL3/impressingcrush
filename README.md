## üõ†Ô∏è Mobile Compatibility Fix

This section addresses the key fix for ensuring the project works perfectly on mobile phones, as you requested: **linking `mobile.js` instead of `script.js`**.

To ensure **optimal performance and interaction** on mobile devices, the `index.html` file needs to link the mobile-specific JavaScript file.

### Action Required in `index.html`

In your `index.html` file, you need to replace the link to `script.js` with **`mobile.js`** to ensure the scripts are optimized for the mobile viewport.

| Current/Desktop Link | Mobile Compatibility Fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| `<script src="script.js"></script>` | `<script src="mobile.js"></script>` |
